### Hi there 👋

<!--
**adoumtaiga/adoumtaiga** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on builing my github profile with Data Science projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analysis, building reports with PowerBI, Machine Learning Argorithms (Classication, Clustering, Regression), Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Data Science Project which can help me further develop my skills.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Deploying machine learning models and Building up Dashboards
- 💬 Ask me about any data science related subject, that's my passion.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the most common programming language used in data science is Python? Python is popular because it has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, a vast collection of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and it can be used for a variety of tasks such as machine learning, web development, and scientific computing. Many data scientists also use tools like Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and prototyping.
