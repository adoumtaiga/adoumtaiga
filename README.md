### Hi Data Scientist ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on builing my github profile with Data Science projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis, building reports with PowerBI, Machine Learning Argorithms (Classication, Clustering, Regression), Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Data Science Project which can help me further develop my skills.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Deploying machine learning models and Building up Dashboards
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any data science related subject, that's my passion.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the most common programming language used in data science is Python? Python is popular because it has a simple and easy-to-learn syntax, a vast collection of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and it can be used for a variety of tasks such as machine learning, web development, and scientific computing. Many data scientists also use tools like Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and prototyping.

### Background

I am a data scientist with a background in software development. I recently completed an end of study internship and earned a degree in data science from the National Advanced School of Engineering in Maroua - Cameroon. I also hold a bachelor's degree in software development from the University Institute of Technology. My skills include exploratory data analysis, data analysis, Power BI, machine learning, and I am proficient in both Python and R for data science. I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems and am always looking to expand my knowledge in the field of data science.
